<p>We have designed an paintbrush that allows you to paint sounds in 3D using the Microsoft Kinect and an IOT (Internet of Things) paintbrush. You simply stand in front of the Kinect and click the button on the brush to start recording sounds in 3D space. Furthermore, slide your thumb on the base of the brush to change the pitch or frequency of the sounds created.</p>
